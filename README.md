  ## Description
  Let's explore an alien planet and learn all the techniques you need to make your own 2D games with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and HTML Canvas. From sprite animation to parallax backgrounds, today we will build a game completely from scratch, with no frameworks and no libraries, using just HTML, CSS and plain vanilla JavaScript. Have fun! 
  
  This project was done following the freecodecamp.org tutoral and youtube.
